                        The safety of our children is paramount. Designing a school security system is a delicate
                        balance of maintaining a free, open, welcoming, creative, and educational atmosphere while still
                        offering a secure location for kids to learn and ease parents’ worries.

                        Access Control at Entrances and Exits. When students are arriving or leaving, all points of
                        movements are monitored by teachers, staff, or administrators as well as cameras. During class
                        time, all outer doors are locked, and all visitors have a single point of access, preferably
                        directly into the main office so they can check in. An intercom is installed with a camera at
                        the primary entrance to verify a visitor’s identity and purpose for visiting before unlocking
                        this entrance and allowing anyone into the building. The school issues photo ID cards to all
                        students, as well as Parent ID and Escort ID cards for parents and others authorised to pick
                        students up after school.

                        and internal threats to student safety. Incidents involving hostile visitors, inappropriate
                        behaviour, bullying, fighting, and other hazards that can harm students can be caught on camera
                        and properly addressed during and after such an event. Plus, any entry points can be observed at
                        all times using this technology.
