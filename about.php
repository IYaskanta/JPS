                                We firmly believe that education should be for life and not just for living. Education
                                should serve not only to develop one's intelligence and skills, but also to help broaden
                                one's outlook. With the changing paradigms of education there is no space for rote
                                learning and passive listening. We will continue to provide our students with
                                opportunities and situations that facilitate them to exhibit their hidden potential to
                                the fullest. We strongly believe that today's generation has an unquenchable thirst to
                                seek knowledge that cannot be satisfied by traditional methods of teaching. JPS with an
                                infrastructure confirming to global standards and an array of opportunities to tap on
                                individual talent, is all set to edify the young learners, keeping in view a synchronous

                                Schooling is a crucial phase in which seeds of both attitude and aptitude are
                                envisioned. We provide an open and accepting environment where children develop their
                                own identity. We at JPS do our part to make this phase conducive for each and every
                                child. We strongly believe that there is more to education than just rote learning. JPS
                                would inculcate a passion and habit for learning.
